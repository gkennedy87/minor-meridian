# What a Restaurant Website Taught Me About Design That Lasts

Some projects stick with you—not because of their complexity, but because of what they reveal about how humans make decisions.  
*On The eDge Tapas* was one of those projects.

The client was a chef opening a new restaurant in a small but competitive downtown area. She needed to stand out fast, build credibility quickly, and attract diners who were open to bold, creative flavors.

This wasn't just a “restaurant website.”  
It became an experiment in emotional design, positioning, and understanding what draws people to try something new.

And even now, in 2025, I still use the lessons from this project.

# The Reflection

Working with a chef—someone deeply creative, expressive, and intentional—forced me to rethink what “good design” means.

I realized:

- People choose restaurants emotionally, not logically  
- A good website should translate personality, not just information  
- Minimalism only works when it’s anchored by strong identity  
- Local SEO is one of the most unfair advantages a new restaurant can get  

This project was one of the first times I saw a direct correlation between **good branding → strong UX → financial outcomes**.

# Condensed Case Study

## **The Challenge**
- New restaurant, zero brand awareness  
- Highly competitive local market  
- Need to communicate personality and creativity immediately  
- Needed online reservations to streamline early operations  

## **The Solution**
- Built a clean, modern WordPress site  
- Focused heavily on imagery, textures, and color restraint  
- Used one accent color (green) for freshness and consistency  
- Wrote copy for a specific persona: *the bold individualist*  
- Implemented local SEO so she would appear early and often  
- Integrated online reservations to reduce operational load  

## **The Results**
- Website started receiving strong organic traffic within the first month  
- Reservation book filled quickly  
- First-month ROI exceeded 100% just from online bookings  
- Client satisfaction was extremely high—one of the best signals of product-market fit for a service-based project

# What This Project Still Teaches Me Today

Even though I now work with much larger organizations, the core principles haven’t changed:

- **Constraints force clarity.**  
- **Design should express, not decorate.**  
- **Good UX is emotional, not just functional.**  
- **Local SEO is still one of the most powerful levers for small businesses.**  

This project expanded my definition of “craft.”  
It made me think more deeply about the purpose of design—and how the right design, delivered at the right moment in a business’s life, can create a measurable outcome.

It’s still one of my favorite early projects for that reason.
