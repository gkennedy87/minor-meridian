# Why I Stopped Running an Agency — And What I Learned

In 2016, starting a web design agency felt like the logical next step. I’d been freelancing, building small websites, taking on whatever work came through referrals, and trying to carve out space in a crowded market. Back then, “running an agency” was still seen as a badge of seriousness.

But over time, the economics changed, the market changed, and—most importantly—I changed.

In 2023, after years of grinding, learning, failing, adjusting, and stubbornly trying to turn *KUMA Marketing* into something scalable, I realized the truth:  
**I wasn’t building a company. I was building a job.**  
A stressful one, at that.

Shutting the agency down wasn’t a moment of defeat. It was an inflection point.

It forced me to rethink how I work, who I serve, and where I create the most value. In 2025, looking back with far more clarity, I can see the decision for what it really was:  
**the start of my actual career.**

## What Changed

There were three realizations that ultimately pushed me in a new direction:

### **1. Clients weren’t hiring “the agency.” They were hiring *me*.**
Every project—from the simplest small business site to custom app work—closed because of trust, not “agency positioning.” The brand name didn’t matter. People cared about the relationship.

### **2. The agency model incentivized the wrong things.**
I spent more time quoting, negotiating, and managing expectations than actually building. Creative and technical quality were constantly pressured by budget constraints.

It made me a worse builder, not a better one.

### **3. The market became saturated, loud, and low-trust.**
Cheap offshore dev shops, AI-generated cookie-cutter agencies, and course-driven “SMMA founders” diluted perceived value across the entire industry.

I didn’t want to compete in that ecosystem.  
I didn’t *belong* in that ecosystem.

# A Quick Look Back: My First Real Turning Point  
### *(Condensed Case Study)*

To understand why leaving the agency world was so important, it helps to revisit one of the last big projects I took on—and what it taught me about the kind of work I actually want to do.

## **The Challenge**
A small business owner needed a website that could generate trust and predictable leads. She had the hustle, the product, and the experience—but no presence online and no digital credibility.

## **The Solution**
I guided her through StoryBrand-style positioning, clarified her message, simplified the user journey, and built a lean website optimized for calls and contact form conversions.

## **The Results**
- Inquiries quadrupled  
- Sales increased 2.5×  
- She built a defensible digital presence almost overnight  

It was one of the clearest examples of how thoughtful design + clear messaging can create real business results.

But ironically, it was also proof that **I didn’t need an entire “agency” infrastructure to deliver meaningful work.**  
Clients were coming for me—not the logo.

# What This Means for My Work Today

Shutting down the agency created space for what I do now:

- **IT consulting**  
- **Digital transformation work**  
- **Enterprise support for international brands in Japan**  
- **Building software, tools, and systems that actually last**  
- **Working deeply instead of broadly**  

It also gave me back something I didn’t realize I had lost:  
**the joy of building things well.**

Looking back, closing the agency wasn’t the end of anything.  
It was a transition—from being a generalist-for-hire to becoming a specialist with a clear path.

And I’m far better for it.
