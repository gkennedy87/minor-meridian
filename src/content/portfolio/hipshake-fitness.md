# Case Study: Modernizing a WordPress Platform to Eliminate Technical Debt

## Client

**Hipshake Fitness**

[Hipshake Fitness](https://www.hipshakefitness.com) is an online fitness and wellness brand offering dance fitness programs, nutrition guidance, recipes, and educational content designed to help women feel confident, healthy, and empowered.

## Challenge

Hipshake Fitness initially approached me to migrate its existing WordPress website to my managed hosting platform after its previous hosting provider significantly increased its pricing.

At first glance, the engagement appeared to be a straightforward website migration. However, once I began preparing the site for deployment, it became clear that the underlying challenge was much larger.

The website relied on a heavily customized WordPress theme developed by a third-party developer who had since left the industry. The theme had received no ongoing maintenance and was incompatible with modern versions of PHP, preventing the website from running reliably on an up-to-date hosting environment.

Although I could make targeted code changes to complete the migration, it quickly became apparent that the unsupported theme represented an ongoing source of technical debt. Every future WordPress core or plugin update would increase the risk of compatibility issues, making routine maintenance more costly and less predictable.

What began as a hosting migration evolved into a project focused on creating a sustainable platform that could support the business for years to come.

## My Approach

I approached the engagement in two phases: first stabilizing the existing website, then eliminating the technical debt that threatened its long-term reliability.

### Platform Migration

I migrated the existing website into a local development environment before deploying it to a staging server.

During the migration, I identified multiple compatibility issues caused by deprecated PHP functions and outdated WordPress hooks. Using the error logs as a guide, I reviewed the theme code, updated the affected functions, and tested each change until the website was fully compatible with a modern hosting stack.

Once the site was stable in staging, I deployed it to production, allowing Hipshake Fitness to transition to its new hosting environment with minimal disruption.

### Eliminating Technical Debt

Although the migration was successful, the unsupported theme continued to generate compatibility issues as routine WordPress and plugin updates were applied through my managed hosting service.

Rather than continuing to patch aging code, I recommended rebuilding the website using the Kadence Theme and Kadence Blocks. As an actively maintained, Gutenberg-native framework, Kadence offered a modern editing experience while significantly reducing the long-term maintenance burden.

Working closely with the client, I rebuilt the website using the new framework and removed several legacy plugins that had become unnecessary. The result was a simpler, more maintainable technology stack that was easier to update and extend.

### SEO & Content Architecture

The rebuild also created an opportunity to improve the website's information architecture.

Working collaboratively with the client, I developed a new SEO content cluster strategy that better organized educational content, strengthened internal linking, and supported long-term organic search growth.

The revised site structure aligned content with user intent while making it easier for the client to continue publishing new content without compromising the site's organization.

### Performance Optimization

Performance improvements were incorporated throughout the redevelopment.

I implemented automated image optimization to serve modern WebP and AVIF image formats where supported, reducing page sizes and improving load times across the site.

Combined with a streamlined plugin stack and modern WordPress framework, these improvements resulted in a faster, more efficient website that was easier to maintain over time.

## Outcomes

Over approximately seven weeks of development and refinement, Hipshake Fitness transitioned from an aging, unsupported WordPress installation to a modern platform designed for long-term growth.

The rebuilt website significantly reduced ongoing maintenance overhead while providing a more flexible editing experience and a stronger technical foundation for future marketing initiatives.

The improved information architecture also strengthened the connection between the website and the client's broader content ecosystem, helping direct more visitors to its educational content and video channels.

Following the launch, Hipshake Fitness experienced a **334% increase in YouTube audience growth**, with the redesigned website serving as a more effective hub for driving traffic to video content.

Perhaps most importantly, the business is no longer dependent on unsupported software. Routine WordPress and plugin updates can now be performed confidently, allowing ongoing maintenance to focus on continuous improvement rather than resolving preventable compatibility issues.
