# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2025-07-18

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! I will share my learning journey as I rebuild my personal website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project from the command line and pushed it to a repo on Github.
2. **Making Pages**: Next, I learned how to create pages and link them together using the file-based routing system. It was pretty easy and required minimal boilerplate.
3. **Making Blog Posts**: I then learned how to create blog posts using markdown... which you are reading now.

## What's Next
I'll finish up this tutorial and then move on to adding content and refactoring elements into reusable components for easier maintenance.
